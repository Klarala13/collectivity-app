### TO RUN THE APP

### FRONTEND COMPONENTS
Right now, all components are part of a template. It must be restructured to contain the real application.

PAGES:
-HOME -> welcome message and items listing
-PROFILE -> user info and messages 
-ITEMSLIST (add, edit, delete items) You should be able to filter by category and by location (user´s city/postal code)
-PROFILE (list of item´s shared, user info, user picture)
-REGISTER
-NAVIGATION

### NICE TO HAVES
-ITEM DETAIL 
-TRANSLATIONS
-RECENTLY SEEN WIDGET, RECENTLY BORROWED WIDGET
-GEO LOCALIZATION FOR DISPLAYING ITEMS NEAR YOU 

### BACKEND ROUTES
We will need to able to login, have an admin login, create/delete/update items and allow users to message eachother and admin. 
We should also be able to display the user´s profile
