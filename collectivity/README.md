### TO RUN THE APP
To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

- cd collectivity
- npm run android
- npm run ios
- npm run web

### FRONTEND COMPONENTS
Right now, all components are part of a template. It must be restructured to contain the real application.

ToDo:
-Login screen -> send request and finish UI
-Register screen
-Messaging screen
-PROFILE -> load user´s item´s 
-ITEMSLIST -> You should be able to filter by category and by location (user´s city/postal code)

### NICE TO HAVES
-ITEM DETAIL 
-TRANSLATIONS
-RECENTLY SEEN WIDGET, RECENTLY BORROWED WIDGET
-GEO LOCALIZATION FOR DISPLAYING ITEMS NEAR YOU 

### BACKEND ROUTES
We will need to able to login, have an admin login, create/delete/update items and allow users to message eachother and admin. 
We should also be able to display the user´s profile
